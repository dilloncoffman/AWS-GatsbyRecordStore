# Gatsby Record Store Review Web App
This project included using Gatsby along with AWS Amplify to pull in data and connect various AWS services. I bootstrapped this project's authentication flow using [Nader Dabit](https://twitter.com/dabit3)'s [Gatsby Auth Starter](https://github.com/dabit3/gatsby-auth-starter-aws-amplify) then I used Amplify to set up an AppSync API, DynamoDB, and hosting. I completed this project as part of my coursework for CIS 4360 Cloud Computing by myself. Feel free to check out my [Google Slides presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18wBEdBv8_ceAr9saf4CkJqiLHx_hSBvWlvBYrqncN5w/edit?usp=sharing) I put together on it and demoed in class.
